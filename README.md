An ***AI virtual assistant***, also called AI assistant or digital assistant, is an application program that understands natural language voice commands and completes tasks for the user.

It is an application that understands voice commands and completes tasks for a user. Virtual assistants are available on most smartphones and tablets, traditional computers, and even standalone devices like the Amazon Echo and Google Home. Leading tech-giants have all launched products that support voice technology. Some examples include Google’s Assistant, Amazon’s Alexa, Microsoft’s Cortana, and, of course, Apple’s Siri.

They combine specialized computer chips, microphones, and software that listen for specific spoken commands from you and can answer back in a voice that you select.

## **The benefits of a virtual assistant**

The power of digital assistants will only grow, and it's inevitable that you'll use one of these assistants sooner or later (if you haven't already). Amazon Echo and Google Home are the main choices in smart speakers, though we expect to see models from other brands down the road.
